# NOTICE: AUTOLOADING IS CURRENTLY NOT WORKING. It is recommended to disable autoloading and load your flight path manually.

# geofs-save

Saves flight path and flight plan when you reload. Useful when you need to clear the cache while on a long flight but want to keep your flight path.

The options are accessible through GeoFS's options menu. Open it and click the 'Save' tab at the bottom.

There, you can turn autoloading on and off, and if autoloading was turned off in your last play session, you will have the option to manually load your flight plan and path.
